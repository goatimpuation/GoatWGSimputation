# Goat WGS imputation
Goat imputation pipeline development using whole genome sequence data of 1,372 diverse goat population (https://www.goatgenome.org/) as a reference population with Beagle 5.3 (https://faculty.washington.edu/browning/beagle/b5_3.html)


**Data and analysis summary**

Four different population analysis will on this github (50K SNP chip to whole genome level)
* Worldwide goats: AdaptMap dataset: 3,197 goats representing 144 breeds from 35 countries across six continents mainly from Europe, Africa, and West Asia (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12711-018-0422-x)
* North American goats: 72 goats of 4 breeds (Angora 25, Boer 13, LaMancha 12, and Spanish 22) from US National animal germplasm (https://agrin.ars.usda.gov/main_webpage_dev/ars)
* South American goats: 181 goats. Costa Rica (Sannen 38, and Cruzada 17), Brazil (Moxoto 30 and Caninde 31), and Argentina (6 differentiated Criollo breeds 65) https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-38812-3
* US dairy goats: 120 goats of five breeds (Toggenburg 25, Saanen 23, Nubian 28, LaMancha 21, and Alpine 23)

_Outcomes_
* Imputation accuracy across chromosome, breeds, and populations
* Single breed vs multibreed reference and region-specific (Africa, Europe, Asia) vs all regions
* Population genomics and diversity analysis from imputed WGS data and comparison with 50K results from corresponding published articles 

Future/ Need data sharing permission:
* India Goats: 225 samples from India with 15 breeds. Axiom HD array https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2023.147691
* Canarian goats: 224 Italian Goats (Palmera 61, Majorera 60, South Tinerfena 39, North Tinerfena 64), and 39 breeds (1007 individuals) from Europe and Africa retrieved from Italian Goat Consortium2 (IGC2) database
